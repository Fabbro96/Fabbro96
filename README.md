# ✨ Welcome to my GitHub profile! ✨

- I'm <strong> Fabrizio </strong>, an italian guy with a lot of passions like photography, beer and cooking.
- I'm currently studying at Universitá degli studi di Verona and I'm at the first year of Computer Science Master's Degree.
- I'm really interested in cybersecurity and I'm trying to learn something about privacy online (and use FOSS apps in my smartphone).

Android user on my smartphone(OxygenOS), EndaviourOS and Windows (_for gaming_) on my laptop and my desktop. I only use mechanical keyboard (now I only have two: an anne pro 2 with lubed Gatheron Red and a Akko Ocean Star 3068 SP with \*sigh\* Cherry Blue switches).
