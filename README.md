# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm <strong> Fabrizio </strong>, an italian guy with a lot of passions like photography, beer and cooking.
\
I'm currently studying at Universit√° degli studi di Verona and I'm at the first year of Computer Science Master's Degree.
\
I'm really interested in cybersecurity and I'm trying to learn something about privacy online (and use FOSS app in my android smartphone).
--- 
Android user on my smartphone(OxygenOS), EndaviourOS and Windows (_for gaming_) on my laptop and my desktop. 
---
I only use mechanical keyboard (now I only have two: an anne pro 2 with lubed Gatheron Red and a Akko Ocean Star 3068 SP with \*sigh\* Cherry Blue switches)
